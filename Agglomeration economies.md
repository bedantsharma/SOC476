==Agglomeration Economies refer to the benefits that businesses and people experience when they are located close to each other, often in cities or industrial hubs. In simple terms, it's like when lots of related businesses or industries group together in the same area, making it easier and cheaper for everyone to do business.==
- Agglomeration economies fall into two basic categories as discussed previously— localization economies (which benefit firms in the same industry) and urbanization economies (which benefit firms in different industries).
- Recognition of localization economies dates back to 19th-century England and the founding father of modern microeconomics, Alfred Marshall (Marshall 1890). He identified three basic types of localization economies— labor-market pooling, intermediate-input sharing, and within-industry knowledge spillovers
- These economies helped drive the localization of Bangladesh’s garment industry in Dhaka and Chittagong (Muzzini and Aparicio 2013), India’s information and communication technology industry in Bangalore (World Bank 2013b), and Pakistan’s finance industry in Karachi (World Bank 2014)

==Labor-market pooling: Access to a shared workforce with specialized skills.

==Intermediate-input sharing: Sharing suppliers or resources among firms.

==Within-industry knowledge spillovers: Exchange of knowledge and innovation within the industry.==
