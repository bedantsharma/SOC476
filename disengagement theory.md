Disengagement theory: A functionalist theory of aging that holds that it is functional for society to remove people from their traditional roles when they become older adults, thereby freeing up those roles for others.

Disengagement is assumed to be functional for older adults, who can leave potentially taxing social roles and instead invest their energies in more private introspective activities.

==Socioemotional selectivity theory: The theory that adults maintain fewer relationships as they age, but that those relationships are of higher quality.==
