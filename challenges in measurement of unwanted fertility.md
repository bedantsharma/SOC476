- Measures of fertility preferences not able to properly consider uncertainty, ambivalence & complexity surrounding childbearing
- MEASUREMENT ERROR: Respondents often give ambiguous responses to questions that ask them about the ideal number of children that they want.
- Large surveys often provide cross-sectional data & thus use ‘retrospective recall technique’ for measuring unwanted & unintended births: susceptible to ex-post revisions.
- Measure of unwanted fertility: At a point looks at ideal number of children that respondent wants & compares it to the no. of living children at time of conceptions for the births that are recorded in birth history data : ==rationalisation bias==
- Prospective techniques avoid the problem of ‘ex-post rationalization’. But since fertility preferences could change over time and reports are obtained months or years before a pregnancy, may not exactly reflect ‘wantedness at conception’
