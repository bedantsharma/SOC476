#urbanisation 
- A combination of increasing life expectancy, falling fertility rates, and low old- age dependency ratios has created the conditions for a “youth bulge” generation.
- The region has disproportionately fewer women, especially at birth, compared with the global average, which could have long-term implications
- Despite the common perception, urban population growth is mainly driven by natural growth and in-situ reclassification rather than rural-to-urban migration. Congestion and weak urban management may also undermine South Asian cities’ pull factors.
