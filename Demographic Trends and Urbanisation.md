## key takeaways -
1. latin America is most urbanised 
2. Middle east and north Africa is 60% urbanised and now the primary cities are project to see major growth but faster growth is projected in secondary cities 
3. Migration likely has a significant role in driving urbanisation levels in EAP.
4. Despite the common perception, urban population growth is mainly driven by natural growth and in-situ reclassification rather than rural-to-urban migration. Congestion and weak urban management may also undermine South Asian cities’ pull factors.
5. in Europe in central Asia - Urban population declined and this is largely attributable to a decrease in fertility rather than to an increase in longevity, which makes aging trends in ECA unique
6. in sub saharan Africa As life expectancy increases, between 2015 and 2050, Africa will have the fastest increase in the world in the number of elderly persons. Small and intermediate cities, not the largest ones, will absorb a bulk of the region’s urban population growth in the future.
