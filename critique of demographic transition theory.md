- Ethnocentric: the path that developed countries took to develop is the same path that developing countries should take.
- many things vary - 
	- birth rates much higher in developing countries compared to birth rates prior to transition in developed countries
	- Levels of mortality also higher
	- Transition occurred due to internal economic development, not as a result of foreign intervention
	- Modernisation did not provide the most accurate picture of what actually occurred in developed countries
