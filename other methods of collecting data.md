# Mobile phone surveys :
- such surveys have been crucial in COVID-19 era
- such surveys are source of high frequency data

## 50,000 interviews on COVD-19 vaccination in Sub-Saharan Africa
- covid-19 disrupted lives and brought in person survey data collection to a halt 
- immunisation against covid-19 : one of the most sustainable solutions to end the pandemic 
- access to vaccines unequal 
- in sub saharan Africa : supply side constraints were high and demand for vaccines were uncertain so there was a data gap to inform the rollout of vaccination campaigns
- Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) team partnered with national statistical offices to obtain 80 rounds of phone survey data across seven Sub- Saharan African countries
- Longitudinal phone surveys:
	-  flexible,
	- rapidly administered
	- cost effective 
	- evidence collected was timely and tailored to specific information needs for vaccinations campaigns in the region.
### key findings of the survey 
1. High vaccine acceptance but low coverage: Low vaccination rates contrast with high levels of vaccine acceptance in SSA through the pandemic
2. ‘Vaccine acceptance ranged from near-universal acceptance in Ethiopia in 2020 to just below seven in ten people in Burkina Faso in 2021 and never dipped below 83% when averaged across the countries we study in any of the three years of data collection’
3. Changes in individual’s vaccine attitudes over time: ‘Across countries, three in ten respondents (29.8%) changed their attitude about COVID-19 vaccination over time'
