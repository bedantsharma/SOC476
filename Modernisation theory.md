- Premodern times, human society governed by “tradition”, but industrialisation and economic changes forced society to alter traditional institutions
- Traditional Societies= fertility and mortality are high 
- Modern Societies = fertility and mortality are low 
- In between is demographic transition
- This theory allowed demographic transition to move from a description of the world to a theory or demographic perspective
## theory - 
- Industrialisation forces societies to alter traditional institutions.
- Death rates declined as the standard of living improved.
- Decline of birth rate lagged that of mortality decline because the social and economic institutions that favored high fertility required time to adjust to the lower levels of mortality.
- Application in the non – European countries - mortality decline has preceded fertility decline and has led to population growth. However, theory offers little insight about the pace and timing of fertility decline.
- Macro-level theory that sees human actors as being buffeted by changing social institutions. Individuals did not deliberately lower their risk of death to precipitate the modern decline in mortality. Society wide increases in income and improved public health infrastructure brought about this change.
