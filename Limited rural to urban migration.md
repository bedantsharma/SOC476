the reasons are - 
1. Not highly urbanised region
2. Is only 1/3rd urban - less than any other region in the world.
3. However, in South Asia urban population. is growing by more than 2.5 percent (14 million people a year). However, these estimates may substantially understate the levels and rate of urbanisation in South Asia.



==In general, national urban population growth can be disaggregated into 3 sources
- ==natural population growth in existing urban areas, 
- ==in-situ reclassification of rural settlements to urban settlements,
- ==and physical migration of people from rural to urban areas.==



- Globally, about half of the growth in urbanisation is attributed to rural to urban migration and reclassification.



- ==Geographic mobility appears generally low in South Asia in comparison to other regions.==
- ==In some South Asian countries, reclassification accounts for more urban growth than does migration.==
