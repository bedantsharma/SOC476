- Cohort Life expectancy : average life length of a particular cohort (a group of individuals born in a given year)
- If we can track a group of people born in a particular year many decades ago & observe exact date in which each one of them died- we can calculate this cohortâ€™s life expectancy by simply calculating the average of the ages of all members when they died.
