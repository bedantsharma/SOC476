#migration1 
the reasons are simple - 
1. it's very hard to measure , so we know less about it the we do about fertility and mortality
2. has been a subject of far more governmental control than have fertility and mortality. what we mean by this is that the government don't have that much control over how and when someone dies or gives a birth but they do have control over migration.
