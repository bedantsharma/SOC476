#internationalMigration 

Classic supply and demand model

- says that workers are attracted form low wage countries with adequate labor, to high- wage countries with limited labor.
- also says it's individual cost benefit decision to maximise expected incomes.
- it also says that migration will keep in happening until the cost of migration doesn't become equal to the social + economic + psychological cost of migration.
