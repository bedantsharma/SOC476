- Original assumption was that populations seek homeostasis— stability in size with birth rates equal to death rates. When reached, the transition would end.
- However, we see that, over the past few decades new patterns have emerged of persistent below-replacement fertility—labeled the “Second Demographic Transition."
- In richer countries fertility has declined beyond replacement levels, Dirk van de Kaa suggested that the change was not just having fewer children, it was also about personal freedom to do what they want to do particularly for women
- This transition would be associated with a postponement of marriage, rise in single living, cohabitation etc. (for e.g. Lesthaeghe and Neels 2002)
