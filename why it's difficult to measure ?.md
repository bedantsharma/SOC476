- unlike mortality the entire population is not subject to the risk of having a birth.
- The event of birth occurs to both a child and parents, characteristics of child as well as the parents are needed.
- Fertility is typically measured only in relation to the mother.
- The same person may have more than one birth but may only die once.
- There are minimum and maximum ages at which men and women are physiologically capable of reproduction
- Regarding the denominator of a fertility rate, not every woman is truly exposed to the risk of childbearing
- Fertility behavior is more influenced by preferences, motivations, social status, etc., than is mortality
- The female and male populations exposed to the risk of childbearing are not ordinarily decreased by having a birth
- In at least one instance, deaths are more difficult to analyze than births: Birth affect only initial age of the age distribution, whereas deaths affect the entire age distribution
