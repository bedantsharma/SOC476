- Risks of death vary by age, thus CDR is affected by distribution of population by age
- Aging populations could have increasing CDRs , even though the health conditions are becoming better
- less developed countries with very young populations will often have lower CDRs than more developed countries even though their overall health conditions are poorer.
- CDR makes no allowance for the mortality pattern in a population by age.
- In most populations, mortality rates are very high in infancy, fall to a low-point in late childhood (around the age of 10), and increase with increasing age thereafter.
- Differences between populations in the Crude Death Rate may reflect differences in their age structures rather than accurately reflect differences in individualsâ€™ propensity to die given their ages.
- Thus, it is important that mortality comparisons across countries should always use mortality indicators that are adjusted for differences in age composition
