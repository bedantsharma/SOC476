#southAsia 
- The demographic phenomenon of ‘missing women’ - disproportionately fewer women than men, especially at birth, compared with the global average.
	- Appears in south Asia
- For all South Asian countries, the sex ratio (women per 100 men) has consistently been slightly lower in the youngest cohorts.
	- Causes - availability of sex selective abortions and neglect of young girls.
- In older cohorts, the ratio evens out.
- However, the regional trend conceals significant variation across countries.
- ==Indian sex ration at birth is moving towards balance in the recent years==
