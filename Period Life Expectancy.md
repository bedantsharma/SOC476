- life expectancy in particular year : the age a person in that year would expect to live if the average age of death did not change over their lifetime
- Estimating average length of life for a hypothetical cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at one particular period – commonly a year.
- This approach leads to what is known as ‘period life expectancy‘ and it is the much more commonly used life expectancy metric
