#urbanisation 
- Among the most urbanised regions in the world, having reached an urban majority by 1960 - a milestone achieved globally only in 2008.
- Average growth rates in cities today are declining, and some city centres are losing population to the urban periphery ==means people are moving from urban to rural setting== 
- Urbanization is shifting towards small and intermediate cities. The region is starting to age rapidly, a trend that is especially pronounced in urban areas.
