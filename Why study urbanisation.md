#urbanisation 
- Demographic trends of fertility, mortality, and life expectancy have a bearing on the age structure of the population.
- Age structure has implications for national policy implications and, depending on the degree of urbanisation, location of cohorts can impact urban policy
- For e.g. countries with a larger share of young cohorts need to invest in maternal and child health, schooling, childcare etc.
- Number of older people worldwide is projected to grow from 901 million in 2015 to 1.4 billion in 2030 to 2.1 billion in 2050
