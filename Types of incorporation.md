1. Adaptation : adjusting to new physical & social environment & learn how to best negotiate everyday life.
2. Acculturation : adopting the host language, bringing their diet more in line with the host culture, listening to music & reading newspapers, magazines, & books of the host culture, & make friends outside of their immigrant group.
3. Assimilation or segmented Assimilation : Many migrants never go beyond linguistic acculturation, but some migrants (and especially their children raised in the host culture) assimilate, in which they take on not just the outer trappings of the host culture, but also assume the behaviours and attitudes of members of the host culture


1. Integration : that is mutual accommodation in which migrants live with native neighbours 
2. Exclusion : in which immigrants are kept separate from most members of the host society and are maintained in separate enclaves or ghettos
3. Multiculturalism or pluralism : immigrants retain their ethnic communities but share the same legal rights as other members of the host society (they don't have to be one hot melting pot)
