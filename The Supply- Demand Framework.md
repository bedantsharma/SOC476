Easterlin and Beckerâ€™s economic framework emphasizes the need for households to balance the demand for children (what are they good for?) with the supply of them.

When the supply begins to exceed the demand, then the motivation to limit fertility emerges.

- mortality declines and children cannot be afforded
- And/ or the opportunity costs of children rise (from what are they good for, to how good are they ?)
