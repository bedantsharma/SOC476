Instead of believing in the “natural” or “eternal” law of population, the Marxists believe that it is important to put it in a particular social and economic environment.
- For capitalism, the consequences are overpopulation and poverty.
- For socialism, population growth is readily absorbed by the economy with no side effect.
The Marxists rejected the notion that poverty can be blamed on the poor.

Poverty is not a “natural” consequence of population growth.

The problem lies in the distribution of goods, not the production.

- In a capitalist society, the capitalists were skimming off some of the workers’ wages as profits for themselves.
- Therefore, they gained more wealth while the working class got poorer.
- Marx argued that capitalism worked by using the labor of the working class to buy machines that would replace the labor, which consequently led to unemployment and poverty.
- In a well-ordered society (unlike the capitalist society), if there were more people, there ought to be more wealth, not more poverty.
