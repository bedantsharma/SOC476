#urbanisation 
Over 55 percent of the world’s population lived in urban areas in 2018; by 2050, this proportion will grow to two-thirds.

United Nations calls urbanisation one of four “demographic mega- trends” (UNDESA 2019), along with population growth, aging, and international migration

Patterns of urbanisation are highly heterogeneous, both within and across countries


Asia and Africa will see both the largest numbers of urban dwellers and the fastest growth in urbanisation
