- Average no. of births a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality
- Expressed as births per woman
- Total fertility rate (TFR) is the sum of the age-specific fertility rates for all women multiplied by five
- Calculated by summing the ASFR’s and multiplying the result by the width of the age interval of the ASFR’s. n = usual width of the age-interval, Usually, n=5
- Useful in interpreting the cumulative fertility implied by a given set of ASFR’s
- No. of children who would be born per woman (or per 1,000 women) if she/they were to pass through the childbearing years bearing children according to a current schedule of age-specific fertility rates.
