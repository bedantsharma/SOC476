Assume you and partner(s) are fully fecund;
- First pregnancy at age 15; Little less than 9 months per pregnancy (to account for some pregnancy loss);
- 18 months between the end of one pregnancy and the start of the next;
- Thus, a woman could have a child every 2.2 years between ages 15 and 49;
- Which equals 16 live births
- still, No known society has ever had 16 births on average. Why?
	- Health and mortality experience of mothers
	- Poor nutrition (raises age at menarche, and also produces anovulatory cycles in which no egg is released)
- “Natural fertility” may be closer to 6 or 7 children per woman (matching the high mortality)
- The Hutterites have come the closest with 11 children per woman in the 1930s:
