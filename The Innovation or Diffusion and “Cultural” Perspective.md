- Many changes in society are result of diffusion of ‘innovations. e.g. trends in fashion, fads
- Fertility decline is produced by the diffusion of new ideas and knowledge about fertility regulation rather than by changes in socioeconomic factors, a hypothesis that we will call ==ideation theory== 
- Ideation’, defined ‘as new ways of thinking that diffuse in a society by means of social interaction’, was introduced by demographers as an alternative explanation of fertility transition.
- Cultural innovation takes place in higher social strata as a result of privilege, education, and resources; lower social strata adopt new preferences through imitation
- Rigid social stratification or closure of class or caste inhibits downward cultural mobility and thus inhibits diffusion of low fertility ideas
