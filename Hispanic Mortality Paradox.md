-  Hispanics in the United States tend to have lower household income, education, and health insurance coverage when compared to non-Hispanic Whites.
- Despite these economic disadvantages, paradoxically, Hispanics have better health outcomes across a range of health and disease contexts compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), an epidemiological phenomenon commonly referred to as the “Hispanic paradox.”’
- For e.g. according to a review article by Ruiz et al. 2012 , findings from 58 studies conducted between 1990-2010, Hispanic populations had a 17.5% lower risk of mortality compared with other racial groups
- The difference in mortality risk was greater among older populations
- ‘In 2019, the Hispanic population had a life expectancy advantage of 3.0 years over the non-Hispanic White population and 7.1 years relative to the non-Hispanic Black population, despite having real household income that was 26 percent lower than non-Hispanic White households (Wilson 2020)



- Markides and Eschbach (2005) emphasize the role of immigration in explaining the Hispanic paradox
- ‘With initial assumption that immigrants need to be healthy enough to endure the cost associated with immigration: travel, adaptation to new customs, new laws, & potentially with few resources or support available.
- The Hispanic health paradox is closely tied to the “healthy immigrant effect” (also known as the “healthy immigrant paradox”)
- The healthy immigrant effect is an observed time path in which the health of immigrants just after the migration is substantially better than that of comparable native-born people but worsens with additional years in the new country


- While life expectancy is an important indicator of the population’s health, the analysis of the Hispanic population must take into account that life expectancy tables do not consider the possibility that some Hispanic deaths are not accounted for due to return migration.’ (Fernandez et al. 2023)
- The return migration of less healthy immigrants to Mexico and Central America (relative to South America and Cuba) would imply that older Hispanics are healthier than non- Hispanic Whites of the same age.’ (Fernandez et al. 2023)
