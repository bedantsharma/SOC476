#urbanisation 
- Fastest growing and youngest region in the world.
- Great diversity of demographic trends among African countries and regions.
- The region has the highest urban growth rates in the world, but a relatively low share of population living in urban areas.
- As life expectancy increases, between 2015 and 2050, Africa will have the fastest increase in the world in the number of elderly persons.
- Small and intermediate cities, not the largest ones, will absorb a bulk of the regionâ€™s urban population growth in the future.
