Transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates

there are 3 types of countries - 
1. Group A: transition complete â€“ population stabilizing
2. Group B: transition underway
3. Group C: transition not yet begun
the original model is divided roughly into three stages:
1. Birth and death rates are high.
2. Transition from high to low birth and death rates. The growth potential is realized as death rate drops before the birth rate drops, resulting in rapid population growth.
3. Death rates are as low as they are likely to go, while fertility should go down to a level equal to the death rate.
