- Computer-based system that enables the integration of maps with geo-referenced data in innovative ways.
- Geo-referenced data means that we know the location (GPS coordinates, census tract, zip code, city, state, country, etc.) where an event (e.g., a birth or death or census/survey questionnaire) occurred.
-  Geo-referencing data to places on the map gives us the ability to combine different types of data for the same place, and for more than one time.
- It enhances our ability to analyze demographic changes over time and space.
