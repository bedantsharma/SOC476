**Demographic metabolism**: Proposed by Norman Ryder in 1965. Over time, each age group in society is replaced by the next younger age group of people. To the extent that the new cohort is different from the one preceding it, society will change over time.

**Easterlinâ€™s relative cohort size hypothesis**: The standard of living you experience in late childhood is the base from which you evaluate your chances as an adult.

- If you can improve your income as an adult compared to your childhood level, you are more likely to marry early and have several children.
- If young people relatively scarce & business good, they will get high wages, and be more comfortable about marrying and having children.
- Conversely, if young people are abundant in supply, even if business is good, stiff competition, difficult to maintain certain standard of living, thus delayed marriage & smaller family sizes.
