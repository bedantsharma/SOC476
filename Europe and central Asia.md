#urbanisation 
- there is a rise in the average age of people.
- Urban population declined in over half of low- and middle-income countries between 1991 and 2011.
- ==and this is largely attributable to a decrease in fertility rather than to an increase in longevity, which makes aging trends in ECA unique.==
- The emigration of young people is reinforcing these trends. The region and its cities will continue to see diverse and contrasting patterns of growth and decline as population aging is expected to accelerate across major cities.
