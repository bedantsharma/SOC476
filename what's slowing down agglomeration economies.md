In theory, unopposed agglomeration economies will increase urbanization & raise prosperity. Increasing concentration of people and production in urban areas would stimulate improvements in productivity and greater competitiveness, which would, in turn, spur more urbanization, creating a second round of increasing productivity and competitiveness, which would lead to a third round, and so on—until urbanization is complete and high-income status attained


but that doesn't happen - 
- Agglomeration economies do not operate unopposed, however. They encounter resistance from congestion forces, which can slow or, if strong enough, even halt the whole process of circular and cumulative causation.
- Congestion can arise from many different potential sources.

why congestion - 
1. Many urban governments are not prepared to meet the surging demand for land, jobs, transportation, housing, basic services, and resilient infrastructure.
2. Providing services will only become more challenging as cities increase in area, diversity and population.
3. South Asia’s largest cities are some of the least liveable places in the world (for e.g. Dhaka)

Sources of congestion - 
1. Land and housing markets: land markets respond slowly to pressures of urban population growth, costly & time consuming to acquire land for development, with growth in cities land prices rise, cost of production etc. rise, rents and property prices in the formal sector often cause households to choose informal housing, rise of slums.
2. Labor markets. Urban growth cause wages to be bid up, eating into profits of firms, unless urban labor markets respond with an increased supply of suitably qualified labor. When the industries fueling growth are low skilled, rural-urban migration can help release the pressure in urban labor markets.
3. Roads: As cities grow, their roads tend to become clogged with traffic. Workers in New Delhi and Bangalore, for instance, suffer among the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM’s Commuter Pain Index
4. Other infrastructure & basic urban services: Urban growth also places pressure on other infrastructure and basic urban services, including solid waste management & such utilities as water & electricity. Unless investment is forthcoming, this pressure can lead to deteriorating levels of quality and service provision, which reduce firms’ and workers’ incentives to locate in a particular city—or even in urban areas at all.
5. Pollution: Due to increased traffic congestion, building activity, bigger cities tend to suffer from poorer air quality. In India, bigger cities have higher concentrations of nitrogen oxide, both an important indicator of air quality and a serious cause of respiratory illness (Lamsal and others 2013).
6. Disease: In addition to diseases that can arise from pollution, infectious diseases can spread faster in dense urban settings than in rural ones.
7. Crime: Cities, by virtue of their density, can create the condi- tions for crime. Larger cities also provide larger markets for drug dealers, fueling the potential for drug-related crime.
