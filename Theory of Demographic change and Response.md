- This theory was advocated by Kingsley Davis. The main theme of this theory was that people respond to demographic changes in terms of personal gains
- Decreasing death rates and a greater number of surviving children puts pressure on resources.
- Parents respond to this by working harder and longer.
- If there are not enough local jobs to go around as children grow up so they migrate elsewhere.
- This new generation of grown up children limit family sizes to avoid putting pressure on resources and gaining more prosperity.
