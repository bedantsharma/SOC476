Definition and Terminology (Note: Questions on fertility preferences usually administered to women of reproductive age groups (typically 15-49 years) & in some surveys to men too).

Two key measures - 
1. desire for more children:
	1. DHS asks currently married women and men aged 15-49: ‘Whether they wanted more children and, if so, how long they would prefer to wait before the birth of the next child. Women and men who are sterilized are assumed not to want any more children.’
2. Ideal family size:
	1. WFS, older multinational surveys (between 1974-1987), asked: “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” 
	2. DHS asks questions to men and women aged 15-49. 
		1. Respondents with no living children were asked: ‘If you could choose the exact number of children you would like to have in your lifetime, how many would you have? ‘ 
		2. Respondents with living children were asked: ‘If you could go back to the time when you had no children and choose the exact number of children you would like to have in your lifetime, how many would you have chosen?’
