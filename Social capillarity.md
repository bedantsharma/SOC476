Late 19th century French demographer who felt he discovered a new principle of population called “social capillarity”
- The desire of people to rise on the social scale, to increase their individuality as well as their personal wealth.
- To ascend the social hierarchy requires that sacrifices be made, including using birth control to have a small family
- He was opposed to this idea because he thought that France’s birth rate was too low.
