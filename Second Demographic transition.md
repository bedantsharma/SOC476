- Second demographic transition: A new demographic model that calls for fertility rates that may continue to fall because of shifts in family structure.
- Key influences include delayed marriage, delayed childbearing, rising rates of cohabitation, high, steady rates of divorce, and the relative ease of obtaining effective means of birth control.
- These circumstances arguably lead to lower birthrates, because under such conditions, many people may prefer not to have children.
