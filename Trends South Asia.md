#southAsia
most common trends in south Asia are youth bulge and gender disparities. 

there is also increasing population due to increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rate.

there are two things that can go down now - 
1. If managed well greater prosperity.Opportunity to leverage benefits of urbanisation and demographic dividend.
2. Failure to deal with increasing population leads to congestion, low quality of life and concentration of poverty and can even result in a situation like Bangladesh. 

Most South Asian countries are classified as “early-dividend” countries with an increasing working-age share of the population. ==Population will increase till 2050 (except Sri Lanka).==

Even as total pop. continues to increase, fertility rates have declined in S. Asian countries, in line with global trends.

- Fertility rate will fall below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman very soon in most countries.
- Happened in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, very recently India.
- Afghanistan 2050 and Pakistan 2060.


The reason population continues to increase despite below replacement fertility rates is that life expectancy has significantly increased & infant mortality significantly fallen in recent decades.
- Infant Mortality dropped by 40 percent
- Life Expectancy increased by 40 percent
