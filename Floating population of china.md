#migration1
The term “floating population” in China refers to people who have not in fact migrated, but who “float and move” meaning that they are not, and generally will not become, a permanently settled group. This transience is because the floating population has not been granted permanent, official household registration in the place in which they are residing. Members of the floating population frequently move back and forth between country side and city and come and go with the seasons.
