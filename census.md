==what is a census ?==

ans - ==The total process of collecting, compiling, evaluating, analysing and publishing or otherwise disseminated demographic, economic and social data pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or in a well delimited part of a country.==

- censuses have a long history but have been systematically collected only since the late 18th century.
- They have a tendency to be contentious when different groups use their numbers for political purposes.
- But, they are also the richest available source of demographic information.
## UN recommendations for censuses :
1. Sponsorship by national government 
2. Defined territory 
3. Universality – include everyone on either de DE Jure or de De facto basis 
4. Simultaneity – a fixed day, hour, and moment becomes the chronological dividing line for inclusion or exclusion. 
5. Individual units (persons) are counted, not groups 
6. Defined periodicity - conduct the census at fixed time intervals (typically every 10 years in India) 
7. Compilation and publication of the data must occur regularly.

==De Jure – the enumeration classifies each person according to his or her legal place of residence. 
De Facto – the enumeration classifies each person according to his or her geographical location on the day of the census undertaking.==

## Who is Included in a census ?
- de facto population - people who are in a given territory on census day
- de jure population - people who legally “belong” to a given area, regardless of whether they were there on the day of the census
- people included in the census on the basis of usual residence - roughly defined as the place where a person usually sleeps
