Pregnancies that occur at a time when a woman or a couple did not wish to have another birth are regarded as unwanted. That is, child wantedness is determined directly, and entirely, on the basis of parental fertility preferences. To be more precise, at issue are fertility preferences at the time of conception; this is the phenomenon of interest if the ultimate goal is to assess the potential impact of more perfect fertility control

Based on the assumption that pregnancy is a conscious decision, unintended and intended pregnancies can be defined as follows by-
- Unintended pregnancies: Pregnancies reported to have been either unwanted (they might have occurred when women/couples desired no children, or no more children) or mistimed (when pregnancies occurred prior to the time they were desired).
- Intended pregnancies: If pregnancies are reported to have happened at the “right time” or later than desired (because of infertility or difficulties in conceiving).

according to NFHS india:
- Unwanted birth: Any birth in excess of the number of children a woman reported as her ideal number.
- Wanted birth: Any birth less than or equal to the number of children a woman reported as her ideal number.
