#unauthorisedIM 
An unauthorised immigrant is a person who immigrates to a host country “through irregular or extralegal channels”

there are three ways some can do that - 
1. during the process of migrating to the host country the person “avoided inspection by crossing borders clandestinely or … traveled with fraudulent documents, e.g., a falsified visa or counterfeit passport”; such persons are referred to as “entries without inspection” (EWIs)
2. the person “overstayed the time limit of a legally obtained non- immigrant temporary visa”; such persons are referred to as “visa overstayers”
3. the migrant violated explicit visa conditions, e.g., obtaining employment while holding a student visa

- In almost all the other countries of the world, except for the U.S., most unauthorised immigrants are visa over-stayers.
- The International Organisation for Migration estimates that the number of unauthorised migrants to be between 30 and 40 million persons. Maybe more now.
- South Africa is a major destination for unauthorised immigrants from other African countries.
- In Asia most of the unauthorised streams of migration are to Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.
