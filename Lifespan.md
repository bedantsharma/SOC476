the oldest age to which a human can survive 

Oldest authenticated age of a human being was 122 years old – Jeanne Calment from France, died in 1997

Age exaggeration is common among older folks – there are many unsubstantiated reports of people living well past 100

One way to check age exaggeration is to compare census records with the age reported on a death certificate (especially if a birth certificate is unavailable)

Life expectancy for the world as a whole is estimated to be around 73 years in 2023
