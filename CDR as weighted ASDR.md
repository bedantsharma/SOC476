- CDR is simply a weighted average of the age-specific death rates, where the weights are the proportions of the population at each age
- Relative sizes of different age groups determine their influence on the CDR
- As mortality varies greatly with age a population's age structure strongly influences its CDR. Therefore, the measure is of limited use for comparing mortality in different populations
