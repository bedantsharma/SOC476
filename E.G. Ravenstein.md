## Laws of migration 

- to understand migration we must understand why people do and don't move 
	- most theories deal with why people do move - the "don't" is much more difficult to discern

This theory was pioneered by Ernst Ravenstein (1885, 1889) in two seminal papers. He postulated that some people move because they are pushed out of their location and others move because they are pulled or attracted to a new location

Itâ€™s often not this simple! The cost/benefit calculation of migration usually takes into account both push and pull factors along with other factors

Decision to move usually occurs over a long period of time
