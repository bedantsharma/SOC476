#urbanisation 
- Experiencing rapid urban growth, second only to Sub-Saharan Africa. EAP became 50% urban in 2018, with most urban inhabitants residing in secondary cities.
- The region also has the largest regional population of elderly but there is an enormous diversity of aging-levels within the region, which are correlated with national income levels.
- Migration likely has a significant role in driving urbanization levels in EAP.
