This theory argues that migration stems from the demands of the economic structure of industrial societies

Inherent tendencies in modern capitalism lead to separate labor markets in two sectors
- The primary sector that produces jobs with secure tenure, high pay, generous benefits, and good working conditions; and the secondary sector typified by instability, low pay, limited benefits, and unpleasant or hazardous working conditions.
- ==Employers are inclined to turn to migrants to fill the jobs in the secondary sector.==
