WFS Criticism: More sensitive to the no.of children women have already had, specifically women at higher parities -a reflection of rationalising the number of children women have had.

WFS version would show higher correlation with existing no. of children respondents already have compared to DHS question - since this asks women to go back to a time when they did not have any children; though it still doesnâ€™t fully solve the problem.
