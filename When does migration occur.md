when the population is able to overcome the intervening obstacles and is willing to move.
### Intervening obstacles
- Distance of destination, cost of getting there, poor health, and other factors may inhibit migration
- Difficult to predict, on wide scale. however we tend to lump them together with the overall “costs” of moving and concentrate our attention on explaining the desire to move
- Economic variables dominate most explanations of why people move

Everett S. Lee proposed a comprehensive theory of migration in 1966 in the journal Demography. The main tenets of his theory were:
- Migrants responding primarily to plus (pull) factors tend to be positively selected.
- Migrants responding primarily to minus (push) factors tend to be negatively selected
- For every migration stream, there is a migration counterstream.
- Migration tends to be more efficient in prosperous time and less so in times of depression
