- The condition of increasing life expectancy and falling fertility rates, low old age dependency has created the conditions for a ‘Youth Bulge’ in South Asia.
- Youth Bulge’ occurs when “a country achieves success in reducing infant mortality, but mothers still have a high fertility rate”
- Once it reaches working age, if the large generation can be absorbed by the labour market, income per capita should rise, other things being equal; the youth bulge will lead to demographic dividend.
- However, if young people don’t find productive opportunity it can lead to political and social instability


Youth Bulge can result in - 
1. can become demographic dividend
2. fuel political and social instability (e.g. Bangladesh)

The degree and specific generation of the bulge vary across countries. for example India 2030, Sri Lanka 2005, Afghanistan 2060, Pakistan 2065
