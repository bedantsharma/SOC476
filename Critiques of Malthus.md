Malthus was extremely pessimistic.

He believed that the urge to reproduce will drive population growth, which leads to poverty, since the means of subsistence can never keep up with population growth

Scholars have critiqued 3 main aspects of Malthus’s theory:
1. Food production could not keep up with pop growth
2. Moral restraint only acceptable preventive check
3. Poverty inevitable result of pop growth
- Assertion that food production could not keep up with population growth
- Charles Darwin’s thinking was stimulated by this error in Malthus’ reasoning. Humans were no different than all living organisms, including corn, in the ability to increase at a geometric rate. We are all competing for space and resources.
- Marx and Engels rejected his conclusion that poverty was an inevitable result of population growth.
- Belief that moral restraint (avoiding intercourse until marriage and only marrying when you can afford the subsequent children) was the only acceptable preventive check.
