Though a greater number of studies are interviewing both partners about fertility desires, this should preferably always be the case
- Larger number of follow-up interviews (e.g., through telephone) should be collected in longitudinal studies in order to reduce the gap in timing between the measuring of fertility desires and a pregnancy occurring.
- Questions in the DHS do not allow for proper detection of reasons for postponement. This short-coming could be addressed through some additional questions.
- Focus on new prospective measures of emotions & expectations near pregnancy points in order to better understand an individualâ€™s motivations and provide them with services they need.
