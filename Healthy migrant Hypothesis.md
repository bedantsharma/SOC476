Migrants represent a positively selected group of individuals with respect to health, relative to the general population in origin societies.
- Young and healthy people are more likely to migrate than elderly or sick.
- In China, rural migrants on average are healthier than the urban population.
- This positive selection holds even for migrant populations from relatively underdeveloped origins experiencing high rates of mortality and morbidity.
